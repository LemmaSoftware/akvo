Thank you for your interest in Akvo! 

Akvo is a surface NMR (sNMR) processing utility. Currently preprocessing is supported, but we are adding inversion capabilities. Let us know if you are looking for something. 

##Configuration
pip install PyQt5 
## Or 
pip3 install PyQt5 

## Installation is done in the typical python fashion
python setup.py build 
python setup.py install    # requires sudo on most installations 

# If you are going to be editing the source code, you may prefer to run 
# the develop option which will not require rerunning the install option 
# for each edit. This is entirely optional 
python setup.py develop    # requires sudo on most installations
