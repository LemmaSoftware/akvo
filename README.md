# Akvo 
Akvo is a surface NMR processing workstation

## Team 
Akvo is developed by several teams including the University of Utah.

## Capabilities 
Akvo currently has preprocessing capabilities for VistaClara GMR data. 

## Benefits 
Processing steps are retained and logged in the processed file header, which is written in YAML. 
This allows data processing to be repeatible, which is a major benefit. 
YAML files are human readible, and easily ediable. 

## Languages
Akvo is written primarily in Python 3, but has components written in R as well. The graphical user unterface is written in PyQt5.  An interface to modelling software written in C++ is in development.
